A project to test out making discord bots in node. It's a simple turn based fighting game; horribly balanced. Runs off a slash command to start, then buttons to control the game itself. Works off embeds.
### Commands:
  - /duel {string1} {string2}
      - Makes a new duel in the channel, a fight between 'string1' and 'string2'; the intention was for this to settle things, like flipping a coin. You can put whatever you want there.
